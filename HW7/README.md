Skyler Lindsey imported data for the autoencoder file, performed preliminary data normalization, and then conducted model testing, validation, training, and prediction. Jacklyn Clauss followed along, learnt the code, and assisted in debugging the data normalization and rerunning the function. Dayanara Yanez and Yuca Chen learnt the programming by following along.
I personally misslead the directions on the homework, and thought that both assignemts where due to due 26, since I only check the canvas and not the  github. I fully take resonsability of the late assignment penalty.


For the clustering file, Skyler Lindsey imported data, processed the data to remove NaN and impute values, and did normalization of the data. Yuca Chen set up and ran the k-means clustering code and the DBSCAN code, and tested hyperparameter values for the DBSCAN code. Jacklyn Clauss helped to test different hyperparameter values for the DBSCAN code. Dayanara Yanez followed along and learned the code.
