#MLTSA25_DYanez

-what is the reason you desided to take this class?
I want to be proficient in ML, so I develop more realistic and faster models for atomic iteractions, so we can have a way to study dynamic proteins and not depend on longer periods of time. 

-what do you hope to learn the most 
I would like to now more how to equilibrate training / process more, so accuracy / sensitibity can have realistic values. 

-what are the strenght. 
I like to problemshot until Im out of options, or out of patience, but I like to make a code work, one way or another.
