Jacklyn Clauss imported necessary python packages, created synthetic data, did point of change detection methods (without rupture), imported LANL earthquake data, and helped tested the rupture package. Yuca Chen and Skyler Lindsey helped tested different models for detecting point of change using rupture, set up code for using rupture, and searched for methods to use from rupture. Yuca Chen and Jacklyn Clauss also worked on troubleshooting the runtime for some Rupture calculations. Dayanara Yanez followed along with the code and learned the techniques.
