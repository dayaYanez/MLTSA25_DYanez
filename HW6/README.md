Dayanara Yanez assisted in creating the DTW algorithm's base and worked with Yuca to debug and test it. Jacklyn Clauss tested part of the DTW algorithm code after learning it. With Dayanara, Yuca Chen assisted with much of the debugging and testing of the DTW algorithm. She also helped run the code and create charts to test the algorithm on various sound clips. Skylar Lindsey followed up and studied the DTW algorithm code, as well as testing portions of it. Individual figure captions were written by each person.
